Feel free to use this mini-app as a sample when you building your own API to some blackbox webapp. It covers the way to login to Google(tm) AdWords using Google(tm) single sign-on, start a campaign, add some domains/keywords, scrap some statistics data.

Some extra features:

 * It tries to emulate a real user-agent (different one for defferent accounts) and do a random delay between each HTTP-request.
 * While you can use requestprocessor.py for all your low-level operations with one account, you can also take a look at 'adwords.mapper' - it's a more high-level interface to work with several accounts at once. It allows spreading Ad-campaigns accross different accounts transparently, but you need to have MySQL database set up to use it.
 * You may also want to enable logging - different levels are available to track all HTTP-requests/URLs.

'adwords.mapper' relies on SQLAlchemy 0.5.x to work with the database, so you need to have it somewhere in your PYTHONPATH if you want to use 'adwords.mapper'.

Check settings.py to set up some important parameters, turn on logging, etc.

As of fall 2009 Google(tm) had slightly changed the interface of AdWords so maybe some changes are required to make it work.
